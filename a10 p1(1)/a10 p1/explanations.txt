This problems can be fixed by calling std:: before each command.
Example: std::string
	 std::cout
	 std::cin and so on.
The std is short for the standard identifiers in c++ that contains the major
commands like cout,cin, and also others. Either we can use 
using namespace std after including the libraries or we can put
std:: before each command in the standard stream.

b)
[Error] 'name' was not declared in this scope

We used to Critter:: to reference the class Critter. By doing that all
variables and functions in class Critter can be accessed using the 
Critter::"variable name" syntax.

The error is that the compiler cant find any variable named name in that local
function. By using the Critter:: , it looks for and can edit any variable
or function in Clitter class.
